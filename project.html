    <h2 id="myTitle">About Girls Education Around the World </h2>
    <h3 id="myParagraph"> Approximately sixty-two million girls worldwide, are not enrolled in school. That's several million girls lacking the oppurtunity to educate themselves & possibly those around them. Both the young & the old deserve an equal chance for an education. However, as these under privileged girls grow older, the battle for an education continues to get harder. Overall, many girls around the world lack the privilege of going to school & that needs to change. </h3>
    <h2 id="mySubTitle">Why Girls Worldwide Cannot Attend School</h2>
    <h3 id="mySecondParagraph">While some girls may not be able to attend school because of the cost. Others may live in areas of conflict, where their school systems are affected in various ways by the violence. On the other hand, many girls are married off at a young age & give birth to a child far before they get their high school diploma. Equally as important, some families would rather send their daughter's to work than school. For instance, Sudan & Afghanistan, where child labor is common. Still, no girl nor women should have to sacrifice their education, & future. </h3>
    <h2 id="myOtherSubTitle"> How Investing In a Girl's Education Could Change The World</h2>
    <h3 id="myThirdParagraph">The world as we know it is changing, but that does not mean that the urge for a girl's education has to. In the long run, simply educating girls from other countries where their education is not a priority could largely influence the future. The Malala Fund states that when a country gives its children a secondary education, their risk of war is cut in half. More so, the chance of a healthy & educated child increases, when produced from a heathy & educated woman. There are endless possibilities, as to what investing in an education for a girl deprived of one, can do. Keep in mind these young women are part of our future, and in most cases have the potential to change the world. </h3>
